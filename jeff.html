          <div class="div2"><img src="Jeffrey.png"></div>
          <div class="div3"><p>Jeffrey (Jeff) Epstein was an American entrepreneur and sex offender. Born and raised in New York City, Epstein began his professional life by teaching at the Dalton School despite lacking a college degree. After his dismissal from the school in 1976, he entered the banking and finance sector, working at Bear Stearns in various roles before starting his own firm. Epstein developed an elite social circle and procured many women and children whom he and his associates sexually abused.
            In 2005, police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein after a parent reported that he had sexually abused her 14-year-old daughter. Federal officials had identified thirty-six girls, some as young as 14 years old, whom Epstein had allegedly sexually abused. Epstein pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 by a Florida state court of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute. He was convicted of only these two crimes as part of a controversial plea deal, and served almost thirteen months in custody but with extensive work release.

          <div class="div5"><p>Epstein was arrested again on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of minors in Florida and New York. He died in his jail cell on August 10, 2019. The medical examiner ruled that his death was a suicide by hanging. Epstein's lawyers have disputed the ruling, and there has been significant public skepticism about the true cause of his death, resulting in numerous conspiracy theories. Since Epstein's death precluded the possibility of pursuing criminal charges against him, a judge dismissed all criminal charges on August 29, 2019. Epstein had a decades-long association with the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, leading to her 2021 conviction on U.S. federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy for helping him procure girls, including a 14-year-old, for child sexual abuse and prostitution. Epstein was known for preferring prepubescents and barely pubescents or looking as such at the very most, to the point of putting girls on extreme particular diets and conditions to keep them mantaining a prepuberal look and body.</p></div>

          <div class="div8"><p>The thing about Jeffrey Epstein's "Suicide" is because it wasn't really a suicide. It was a murder. So, basically, he was in prison for the child trafficking shit on his island, right? He was rich and could pay his own bail, and also had thousands of celebrities who owed him favors. Basically, he had thousands of trump cards to get out of jail. So, then, why would he kill himself? If he lived, he would've been free. Also, let's think about the circumstances. He was last reported to be seeming happy, and seemed to be also very careless. On the night of his "suicide" somehow, everything "went wrong." These things being: - His security cameras for his cell not working. - There wasn't a guard watching him like there was supposed to be. - They had special doctors examine his body, and his injuries were WAY MORE linked to strangling / assault than from suicide. The government also claimed that he committed suicide via hanging himself from his bed with his blanket / sheets. I don't recall his bed being high enough for him to be able to hang himself, and it would have been very hard for him to actually hang himself this way. This is all from memory though, I don't have any sources open. So this is all I have to say. Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.</p> </div>
